# SSHEcho

An echo server, to allow basic testing of SSH clients. Currently only supports 'exec' commands, not interactive shells.

To start listening on a port:

    iex> SSHEcho.start_daemon 55555, "fred", "secret"
    :ok

This will now echo back any 'exec'ed commands to that port:

    $ ssh -p 55555 fred@localhost hello
    SSH server
    Enter password for "fred"
    password:
    hello
    $

Then to stop the daemon:

    iex> SSHEcho.stop_daemon 55555
